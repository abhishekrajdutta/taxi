A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients based motion planner for a turtlebot. 

The planner uses range measurements via a laserscan as its primary inputs for obstacle avoidance. An indoor environment was simulated in Gazebo to test the algorithm.

Additionally, this project uses TensorFlow and ROS for its implementation.
